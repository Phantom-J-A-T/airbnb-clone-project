## 🔐 API Security

Security is a fundamental aspect of the Airbnb Clone project. Since the platform handles sensitive information such as user credentials, payment details, and booking data, it’s essential to implement multiple layers of protection across the system.

### 🪪 Authentication
Ensures that only verified users can access their accounts or perform actions.  
- **Implementation:** Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 for secure login sessions.  
- **Importance:** Prevents unauthorized access and identity theft by validating each user’s identity before granting access to restricted resources.

### 🧾 Authorization
Determines what actions a user is allowed to perform within the platform.  
- **Implementation:** Role-based access control (RBAC) — distinguishing between guests, hosts, and administrators.  
- **Importance:** Protects sensitive operations such as property management or admin functions from being accessed by unauthorized users.

### 🧱 Input Validation & Data Sanitization
Prevents injection attacks (like SQL injection or XSS) by validating and sanitizing all incoming data.  
- **Implementation:** Use Django’s built-in validation mechanisms and serializers from Django REST Framework.  
- **Importance:** Ensures that malicious or malformed inputs cannot compromise the database or frontend integrity.

### 🚦 Rate Limiting & Throttling
Limits the number of requests a user or client can make within a given timeframe.  
- **Implementation:** DRF’s throttling system or API gateways (like Nginx or Cloudflare).  
- **Importance:** Protects the API from brute-force attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attempts, and abuse of resources.

### 🔒 Data Encryption
Secures all sensitive data both in transit and at rest.  
- **Implementation:** Use HTTPS with SSL/TLS for all API requests, and encrypt stored passwords using bcrypt or Argon2.  
- **Importance:** Prevents data leaks and protects sensitive information such as user credentials and payment details.

### 💳 Payment Security
Ensures that financial transactions are handled safely through verified gateways.  
- **Implementation:** Integration with secure third-party services like Stripe or PayPal using tokenized payments.  
- **Importance:** Protects users’ financial information from exposure and fraud.

### 🧠 Security Auditing & Logging
Tracks system activity to detect suspicious actions or breaches.  
- **Implementation:** Use Django’s logging framework and monitoring tools like Sentry or ELK Stack.  
- **Importance:** Helps detect security incidents early, supports compliance, and assists in forensic analysis after an event.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### 🧠 What is CI/CD?
**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** are automated processes that streamline software development, testing, and deployment.  
They ensure that every new code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed without manual intervention.

### 💡 Why It’s Important
- **Consistency:** Ensures all environments (development, staging, and production) remain synchronized.  
- **Speed:** Accelerates the release cycle by automating repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.  
- **Quality:** Automatically runs test suites, ensuring new changes don’t break existing functionality.  
- **Reliability:** Reduces human error by using automated workflows for code integration and release.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying the app whenever code is pushed or merged.  
- **Docker:** Containerizes the application, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.  
- **Docker Compose:** Manages multi-container setups for services like the backend, database, and frontend.  
- **Render / AWS / Vercel:** Deployment platforms used to host both the backend API and frontend interface.  
- **pytest / Jest:** Testing frameworks integrated into the CI pipeline to validate backend and frontend logic before deployment.

### 🧩 Example Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to the main branch or opens a pull request.  
2. GitHub Actions triggers the CI workflow — linting, running tests, and building Docker images.  
3. If all tests pass, the CD workflow deploys the updated containers to the production environment.  
4. Notifications or logs confirm successful deployment.
